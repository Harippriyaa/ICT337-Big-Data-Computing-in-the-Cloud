# ICT337-Big-Data-Computing-in-the-Cloud

ICT337 Big Data Computing in the Cloud introduces students to the challenges of processing big data. It provides a foundational understanding of how computing clusters can be setup for big data processing. Students learn how to set up computing clusters that manage resources and schedule jobs in the cloud to perform relevant data analytics. Through hands-on training with relevant tools, students develop programs for processing big data. With such knowledge, students are able to develop smart solutions that can handle real-time big data.
